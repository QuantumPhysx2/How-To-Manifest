# How-To-Manifest
Layout of setting a Manifest to convert a web app to be installed on mobile

Note:
- the CSS and JS file do not contain anything as the purpose of this repository is to provide the layout of the manifest.json for future work 
- REMINDER! Where there is a <______> is to be replaced with content relevant with YOUR web page. Failing to provide correct changes will result in the Manifest not registering properly or at all
